// Creative Tilt:
//  -I made the game reactive to the player, allowing the player to earn higher scores the more daring they are. For example, the player earns more points the closer they are to the front of the screen.
//  -I styled all of my art to keep the entire game uniform. I think that my game looks very visually interesting and clean.
